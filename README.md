# Auto 3BM Sculpting (Blender Addon)

## This addon automatically enables "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" when entering sculpt mode

## Why I created this?
A problem that I had was some feature interference in blender, simply when you enable "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" in preferences you can use the "Alt" key combinations for navigation. I found this type of navigation very useful for sculpting with tablets and stylus pens (and you can use your pen buttons for other things, and not for simulating the middle mouse button). But with this setting, you can't use "Alt" for other things, like "Alt Left Mouse" for selecting edge loops.

So I thought It would be cool if we could use "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" only when we are in sculpting mode. I wrote a simple add-on that just does this. It automatically enables "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" when entering sculpt mode.

I have only tested this script on my own laptop with blender 2.93, but I guess it should work with 2.80 and above.
